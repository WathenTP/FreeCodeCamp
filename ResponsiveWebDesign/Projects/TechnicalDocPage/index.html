          A website user interface (UI) has two components. First there are
          visual elements e.g. colours, font and images. Second there is the
          placement or positioning of those elements. In responsive web design,
          a UI layout must accommodate many different browsers and devices
          accessing content.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          CSS3 introduced flexible boxes, or flexbox, to create page layouts for
          a dynamic UI. It arranges elements in a predictable way for different
          screen sizes. The syntax for which is:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>display:flex</code></li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="positioning_boxes">
        <header><h1>positioning boxes</h1></header>
        <p>
          The CSS property display: flex; when placed on an element allows you
          to use other flex properties to build a responsive page.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          By adding display: flex; to an element turns it into a flex container.
          This makes it possible to align any children of that element into row
          or column. This is done by adding the flex-direction property to the
          parent item and setting it to row or column. With the former aligning
          align children horizontally and the latter will align vertically.
          Other options are row-reverse and column-reverse. The default setting
          for this is always row.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>flex-direction: row</code></li>
          <li><code>flex-direction: column</code></li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="justify_content">
        <header><h1>justify content</h1></header>
        <p>
          Sometimes flex items within a flex container do not fill all the space
          in the container. Often, we want to tell CSS how to align and space
          out the flex items in a certain way. This can be done with
          justify-content: which has several options.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          One of the most common options is justify-content: centre; which
          aligns all the flex items to the centre inside the flex container.
          Other options include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>justify-content: flex-start;</code>
            <p>
              Aligns items to the start of the flex container. For a row this
              pushes them to the left and for column this pushes to the top.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>justify-content: flex-end;</code>
            <p>
              Aligns items to the end of the flex container. For a row this
              pushes them to the right and for a column this pushes them to the
              bottom.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>justify-content: space-between;</code>
            <p>
              Align items to the centre of the main axis, with extra space
              placed between items. The first and last times are pushed to the
              very edge of the container. For a row the first item is against eh
              left side and the last item is agains the right and the other
              items are spaced evenly.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>justify-content: space-around;</code>
            <p>
              Similar to space-between but the first and last items are not
              locked to the edges of the container, instead space is distributed
              around all the items.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="align_items">
        <header><h1>align items</h1></header>
        <p>
          The align-items property is similar to justify-content when aligning
          content with the latter items are aligned along the main axis; for
          rows, this is a horizontal line and for columns this is a vertical
          line.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          CSS offers align-items property to align flex items along the cross
          axis. For a row it tells CSS how to put the items in the entire row up
          or down with a container and for a column it tells it how to push all
          items left or right within the container.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>align-items: flex-start;</code>
            <p>
              Aligns to the start of the flex container, for rows this is to the
              top and for columns this is to the left.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>align-items: flex-end;</code>
            <p>
              Aligns items to the end of the flex container. For rows this is to
              the bottom of the container and for columns this is to the right.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>align-items: center;</code>
            <p>
              Align items to the center. For rows this vertically aligns items
              with equal space above and below and for columns it aligns
              horizontal with equal space to the left and the right.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>align-items: stretch;</code>
            <p>
              Stretch items to fill the container. For example rows are
              stretched to fill the flex container top-to-bottom.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>align-items: baseline;</code>
            <p>
              Align items to their baseline, this is a text concept, think of it
              as the line that letter sit on.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="flex_wrap">
        <header><h1>flex wrap</h1></header>
        <p>
          By default a flex container will fit all flex items together. For
          example a row will all be on one line. However, using the flex-wrap
          property tells CSS to wrap items.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This means extra items move into a new row / column. The break point
          of where the wrapping happens depends on the size of the items and the
          size of the container. CSS also has directions for the wrap.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>flex-wrap: no-wrap;</code>
            <p>Default setting and doesn't wrap</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>flex-wrap: wrap;</code>
            <p>
              Wraps items from left-to-right if in a row or top-to-bottom if
              they are In a column
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;</code>
            <p>
              Wraps items from bottom-to-top in a row or right-to-left if in a
              column.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
